### A PII analyser for image content

In this era of social media where we share almost everything about our lifes from photos to check-ins. But sometimes social media which was made to connect people could be used against as. Instagram where we share our photos with our followers, these photos can also contains PII (Personally Identifiable Information) like phone numbers, Aadhar number, location in which you stay, bank details etc. Obviously no one would share them deliberately but sometimes this happens and the person faces the consequences. </br>

So we made a model which would detect group different types of PII detected in the photos. With this we would be able to analyse the % of PII a user shares on his/her instagram. The future use of this model is great like we could develop an app in which you first upload a pic which could analysis if there is any PII detected in our picture / information which could be used against us.
